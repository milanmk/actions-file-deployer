# FTP/SFTP file deployer

Fast and customizable deployment with parallel connections and proxy support. Deploy only changed files or do full sync/mirror of repository content.

This is a composite GitHub Action (Linux runner) for deploying repository content to remote server.

## Features

- Support for FTP and SFTP (SSH) protocols
- Use password or SSH private key for authentication of SFTP connection
- Delta file synchronization for faster deployment of only changed files since last revision
- Mirroring feature to copy entire file and folder structure of repository content
- Optimized for faster file transfers via parallel connections
- Connect to remote server via [SOCKS proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) using [SSH tunneling](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling) to bypass firewall / NAT / IP whitelist / VPC
- Uses [composite action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-actions#types-of-actions) without Docker container for faster deployments and shorter run time
- Pass additional command arguments to SSH and FTP client for custom configurations and settings
- Step runs messages categorized nicely in log groups
- Run additional FTP commands after synchronization

### Notes

- Character support for `remote-user` and `remote-password` is limited due to its usage in [.netrc file](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/manual/html_node/The-_002enetrc-file.html)
  - It should not contain shell/URL special characters
- File synchronization options
  - `delta`: Transfer only changed files (upload and delete) since last revision
    - Only supported for `push`, `pull_request` and `workflow_dispatch` [events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows)
    - Requires `fetch-depth: 0` option in [checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
    - It is recommended to initially do a full synchronization and then switch to delta
  - `full`: Transfer all files (upload)
    - Does not delete files on remote host
    - Default glob exclude pattern is `.git*/`
- For `ftp-options` and `ftp-mirror-options` command arguments please refer to [LFTP manual](https://lftp.yar.ru/lftp-man.html)
- `ftp-post-sync-commands` can be used to run additional LFTP commands after the
    synchronization. For example, to upload a file watched by a process manager
    on the server in order to restart a deamon:
    ```
    ftp-post-sync-commands: |
      !touch watched_file
      put watched_file
    ```
- Setting `webhook` to a URL will send start and finish event notifications in JSON format
  - start event payload:
  ```
  {
    "timestamp": "1234567890",
    "status": "start",
    "repository": "owner/repository",
    "workflow": "workflow name",
    "job": "deploy",
    "run_id": "1234567890",
    "ref": "refs/heads/master",
    "event_name": "push",
    "actor": "username",
    "message": "commit message",
    "revision": "da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709"
  }
  ```
  - finish event payload:
  ```
  {
    "timestamp": "1234567890",
    "status": "finish",
    "repository": "owner/repository",
    "workflow": "workflow name",
    "job": "deploy",
    "run_id": "1234567890",
    "ref": "refs/heads/master",
    "event_name": "push",
    "actor": "username",
    "message": "commit message",
    "revision": "da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709"
  }
  ```
- Enabling `artifacts` will upload transfer log and modified files to artifacts
  - Modified files are only added for delta file synchronization
- Enabling `debug` option will output useful context, inputs, configuration file contents and transfer logs to help debug each step
- It is strongly recommended to use [Encrypted Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) to store sensitive data like passwords and private keys

## Planned features

- [x] Add transfer log to artifacts
- [x] Add modified files to artifacts
- [ ] Add steps logging to file
- [ ] Add steps log to artifacts
- [x] Trigger webhook at start and end of step runs
